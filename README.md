I started this project after a call with a mentor that lasted almost three
hours. I first used Vite and worked on a multi-page website. The layout did not
include pages for authorization, registration, mobile menu, and modal window, so
I added them myself.

My goal was to create a product that would be fully functional in terms of
frontend.
